## Downloads
Latest Release:
[Connectors](https://github.com/Gerb-24/Connectors/releases/latest)

the .zip file is the only thing you have to download

## Usage
some fields are already filled in by default, but you can change them as you want
when you compile, a new vmf is named with the name (your vmf name)_connected.vmf
when you save settings, the textures and the vmf together with its location are saved in the settings.json file, so that when you open the exe again everything is still there
